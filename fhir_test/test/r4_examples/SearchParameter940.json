This will refer to part of a locus or part of a gene where search region will be represented in 1-based system. Since the coordinateSystem can either be 0-based or 1-based, this search query will include the result of both coordinateSystem that contains the equivalent segment of the gene or whole genome sequence. For example, a search for sequence can be represented as `referenceSeqId-window-coordinate\u003dNC_000001.11$lt345$gt123`, this means it will search for the MolecularSequence resource with a window on NC_000001.11 and with position \u003e123 and \u003c345, where in 1-based system resource, all strings within region NC_000001.11:124-344 will be revealed, while in 0-based system resource, all strings within region NC_000001.11:123-344 will be revealed. You may want to check detail about 0-based v.s. 1-based above.","code":"referenceseqid-window-coordinate","base":["MolecularSequence"],"type":"composite","expression":"MolecularSequence.referenceSeq","xpathUsage":"normal","multipleOr":false,"component":[{"definition":"http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/MolecularSequence-referenceseqid","expression":"referenceSeqId"},{"definition":"http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/MolecularSequence-window-start","expression":"windowStart"},{"definition":"http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/MolecularSequence-window-end","expression":"windowEnd"}]}
