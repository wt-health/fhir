If the units are omitted, then kms should be assumed. If the distance is omitted, then the server can use its own discretion as to what distances should be considered near (and units are irrelevant).\n\nServers may search using various techniques that might have differing accuracies, depending on implementation efficiency. If the server is unable to understand the units (and does support the near search parameter), it MAY return an OperationOutcome and fail the search with a http status 403 BadRequest. If the server does not support the near parameter, the parameter MAY report the unused parameter in a bundled OperationOutcome and still perform the search ignoring the near parameter.","code":"near","base":["Location"],"type":"special","expression":"Location.position","xpath":"f:Location/f:position","xpathUsage":"nearby"}
