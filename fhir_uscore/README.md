# fhir_profiles

Profiles are a way to simplify FHIR® implementations. FHIR obviously can be quite complicated. To create a resource with all of its intricacies, can be difficult and require a deep knowledge of the specification and medicine. FHIR Profiles create minimal requirements for some of these resources, and allow an easier way to create them.

Currently this will only have the US Core Profile, but others will be added in the future. Unless specified, all are based on R4.
